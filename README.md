# 🍽️ basic Restaurant Recommendation System 

This is my **first-ever project** — a beginner-level **Restaurant Recommendation System** ! 
It recommends restaurants based on factors like **cuisine**, **ratings**, **price**, and **distance** — all through a web interface!

## 📌 Problem Statement

With so many restaurants to choose from, users often struggle to find the best options quickly.  
This project aims to solve that by building a smart system that recommends restaurants based on user preferences.
